# New GCloud CLI Profile

Ideally you are automating all the things and are fortunate enough to not need to use `gcloud` or `kubectl` commands.  If you do need these commands use this guide as the rest of this repo assumes you have done these steps here.


1. Your access is granted to GCP via UW Groups membership within the [u_mciman_tenants_iam_operators](https://groups.uw.edu/search/?name=u_mciman_tenants_iam&stem=&member=&owner=&type=effective&scope=one) group.
1. You need `kubectl` from something that can access our clusters. The recommended way is via 
   [Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/), an in-browser shell with a lot of the utilities installed
   and configured. Simply go to [the console](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard) and click
   `Activate Cloud Shell`. See https://wiki.cac.washington.edu/display/MCI/Google+Cloud+Shell+Starter+Tips for more details.

You can see more instruction in this file's commit history, but the information at https://wiki.cac.washington.edu/display/MCI/Google+Cloud+Shell+Starter+Tips is more accurate.
